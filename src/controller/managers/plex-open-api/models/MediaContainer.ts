/**
 * `MediaContainer` is the root element of most Plex API responses. It serves as a generic container for various types of content (Metadata, Hubs, Directories, etc.) and includes pagination information (offset, size, totalSize) when applicable.
 * Common attributes: - identifier: Unique identifier for this container - size: Number of items in this response page - totalSize: Total number of items available (for pagination) - offset: Starting index of this page (for pagination)
 * The container often "hoists" common attributes from its children. For example, if all tracks in a container share the same album title, the `parentTitle` attribute may appear on the MediaContainer rather than being repeated on each track.
